Weather App for the Odin Project

Ideas that I'll maybe do one day
- Have an icon set for the night weather, the API used doesn't seem to have it. 
- Max and min temeperatures, API doesn't have this data?
- Autofill the search bar to give a list of cities/ countries
- If an invalid input is entered, return with a invalid prompt

- Actually make the API private, i dunno how to do that 
  -I'll come back to this once I learned how to use nodejs
