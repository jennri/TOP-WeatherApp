Weather App for the Odin Project 
Used webpack, javascript, html and css
Visually is okay on Chrome and Edge, Firefox is a bit weird

Working app
- Can look up cities
- Shows city and country
- Shows weather in C and F, humidity, UV and wind
- Uses https://www.weatherapi.com/

Ideas that I'll maybe do one day
- Autofill the search bar to give a list of cities/ countries
- If an invalid input is entered, return with a invalid prompt
- Better/smoother animations
